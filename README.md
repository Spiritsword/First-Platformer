# First-Platformer
Platformer game created by Jonathan Puddicombe for AIE Games Programming Course 2016. Many of the assets were provided by the course as were game development concepts and boilerplate for a platformer.

To play, go to http://spiritsword.github.io/First-Platformer/

Use arrow keys to move, up arrow key to jump and space bar to shoot the bombs (but don't get too near).
