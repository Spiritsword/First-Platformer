# First-Platformer
Platformer game created by Jonathan Puddicombe for AIE Games Programming Course 2016. Many of the assets were provided by the course as were game development concepts and code framework for a platformer.

To play, go to http://spiritsword.github.io/First-Platformer/

Use left and right arrow keys to move, up arrow key to jump and space bar to shoot the bombs (but don't get too near).
